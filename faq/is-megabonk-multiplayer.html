        <h2>Short Answer: Is Megabonk Multiplayer Right Now?</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re wondering whether you can jump into Megabonk with your friends in the same run,
          the answer is simple:
        </p>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Feature</th>
              <th>Available in Megabonk?</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Game mode</td>
              <td>Single-player only</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Online co-op</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Local / couch co-op</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>PvP / duels</td>
              <td>No</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
          The Steam store page and multiple third-party guides list Megabonk as a
          <strong>single-player survival roguelike</strong>, focused on solo runs, build crafting,
          and leaderboard chasing rather than on co-op systems or matchmaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, if you buy Megabonk, you’re buying a high-tempo, solo action roguelike experience.

        <h2>Why Do So Many Players Ask for Multiplayer?</h2>
        <p>
          It’s very natural that “Is Megabonk multiplayer?” is one of the most common questions around the game.
          There are a few reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Genre expectations.</strong>
            Megabonk lives in the same general space as other horde-survivor and action roguelike games.
            Many titles in this space either already have co-op or receive constant “co-op when?” requests,
            so players assume it might be planned here too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Huge player base.</strong>
            Since launch, Megabonk has pulled in a massive audience on Steam, with tens of thousands of concurrent players and very high review scores. In communities this large, a big share of players naturally want to play together, not just side-by-side in single player.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Perfect “chaos with friends” fantasy.</strong>
            The over-the-top builds, silly enemies and screen-filling projectiles make Megabonk
            look like the kind of game that would be hilarious with friends shouting over each other in voice chat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That’s why you’ll see plenty of forum threads, Reddit posts and guide articles all circling around
          the same core question: <em>“This game is awesome—can I play it with my friends?”</em>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Dev Comments &amp; Future Plans for Multiplayer</h2>
        <p>
          So what has the developer actually said?
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In community discussions summarized by gaming sites, the developer has explained that
            <strong>multiplayer “isn’t for the game right now”</strong>, and that the current focus is on performance,
            balance, and core content.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the same time, those reports note that the dev is <strong>interested in looking into multiplayer
            in the future</strong>, alongside mod support and other long-term features. There is
            <strong>no official roadmap or release window</strong> for any kind of co-op mode.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Multiplayer is not part of the current, supported version of Megabonk.
          </strong>
          It’s something the dev has talked about as a possible future direction,
          but with no promises or dates attached.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given that Megabonk is developed by a single creator and is still receiving frequent patches to its core systems,
          it’s realistic to assume that any official multiplayer—if it happens at all—would arrive as a
          <strong>major long-term update</strong>, not a quick feature toggle.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How to “Play Megabonk with Friends” Anyway</h2>
        <p>
          Even though Megabonk doesn’t have built-in co-op, there are still plenty of ways to enjoy it
          <strong>together with friends</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Race Each Other Using the Same Rules</h3>
        <p>
          You can treat Megabonk like a shared challenge game:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pick the <strong>same character and map</strong>.</li>
          <li>Agree on some simple rules: “No rerolls”, “No anvil”, “No defensive tomes”, etc.</li>
          <li>
            Start your run at the same time in voice chat and see who:
            <ul>
              <li>Survives the longest</li>
              <li>Reaches a certain wave fastest</li>
              <li>Gets the highest kill count or gold</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This “parallel run” style is already popular in the community and scratches a similar itch to co-op:
          you’re reacting to the same chaos, comparing builds, and trash-talking in real time,
          even though you’re technically in separate runs.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Compete on Leaderboards and Achievements</h3>
        <p>
          Megabonk is built around <strong>competitive leaderboards, rich stats, and a huge list of achievements</strong>,
          which naturally lend themselves to friendly rivalry.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pick a category (e.g., “fastest clear on a certain map” or “highest score with a specific character”).</li>
          <li>Add your friends or community members.</li>
          <li>Refresh the leaderboard and try to snipe each other’s placements week after week.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For easier comparison outside the game client, you can use external leaderboard views or curated “top runs”
          pages if you have them—for example:
          <a href="https://www.megabonk.org/leaderboard/">Megabonk.org leaderboard hub</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Share and Copy Builds</h3>
        <p>
          Another low-friction way to “play together” is to share
          <strong>build ideas</strong>:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Post screenshots of your best runs, items, tomes, and upgrades.</li>
          <li>Challenge friends to recreate your build and beat your score.</li>
          <li>
            Use community tier lists and build guides to create “rulesets” that everyone must follow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re looking for build inspiration, start with:

      <section>
        <h2>What About Multiplayer Mods?</h2>
        <p>
          Because official multiplayer doesn’t exist, some community members have started exploring
          <strong>unofficial multiplayer mods</strong>. Forum discussions have highlighted fan projects that aim to let
          players “bonk with friends” through custom modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few important notes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These mods are <strong>not official</strong>, not endorsed by the developer, and may break whenever the game updates.</li>
          <li>Installing them usually requires tinkering with game files and may cause crashes, desyncs, or performance issues.</li>
          <li>
            If you care about stable achievements, leaderboards, and a smooth experience, the safest way to play is
            <strong>still the vanilla single-player version</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you do experiment with mods, treat them as an unsupported, “at your own risk” side project.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>If You Really Need Co-Op: Similar Games to Consider</h2>
        <p>
          If your <strong>top priority</strong> is playing a roguelike or horde-survivor with friends, you might want to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stick with Megabonk for solo chaos, build crafting, and leaderboard racing; and</li>
          <li>
            Pick one or two co-op-friendly titles alongside it for your dedicated multiplayer sessions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There is no shortage of excellent co-op roguelikes and survivors-likes on Steam that already support
          online or local multiplayer. Combining one of those with Megabonk often gives you the best of both worlds:
          tightly designed solo runs <em>and</em> nights of shouting with friends in co-op.
