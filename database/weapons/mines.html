            <h2>📋 Weapon Overview</h2>
            <p><strong>Mines is a C-tier/D-tier tactical trap weapon in Megabonk</strong> that deploys explosive devices on the ground to damage enemies who walk over them. With <strong>7 base damage</strong>, Mines represents one of the lowest-damage weapons in the game while offering a unique pre-emptive damage approach distinct from active projectile weapons. The weapon requires complex double-unlock conditions—first acquiring Slutty Rocket, then killing 7,500 enemies with it—making Mines one of the most challenging weapons to access.</p>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Critical Warning:</strong> Mines consistently ranks among the weakest weapons in Megabonk across all community tier lists. The weapon's low damage, passive playstyle, and extreme unlock requirements make it unsuitable for competitive play. This guide exists for completion purposes and to help players who encounter it during experimentation.
            </div>

            <p>The weapon's core concept—laying traps that enemies trigger—creates interesting strategic possibilities in choke points and boss arenas. However, fundamental design issues prevent Mines from competing with meta alternatives. The passive damage application means players cannot actively control when damage occurs, enemies must walk into specific locations for any damage to happen, and the low base damage requires massive investment to become relevant.</p>

            <p>Community consensus places Mines in <strong>C-tier at best, with several sources ranking it D-tier</strong> (the absolute worst category). Players pursuing optimal builds should avoid this weapon entirely, focusing instead on proven S-tier alternatives like Aura, Dexecutioner, or Katana. Mines exists primarily as a novelty option for players who have exhausted standard strategies and want experimental gameplay.</p>

        <!-- Unlock Requirements -->
        <section id="unlock">
            <h2>🔓 Double Unlock Challenge</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Unlock Slutty Rocket</h3>
            <p>Before accessing Mines, players must first unlock the <strong>Slutty Rocket weapon</strong> by killing 15,000 enemies specifically as the character CL4NK. This prerequisite alone requires significant time investment:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Character requirement:</strong> CL4NK (must be unlocked first by completing Forest Tier 1)</li>
                <li><strong>Kill count:</strong> 15,000 enemies cumulative across multiple runs</li>
                <li><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 10-15 hours of gameplay depending on skill level</li>
                <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Focus on efficient XP farming runs with Cursed Tome to increase enemy density</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box tip">
                <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong> Use CL4NK's crit-focused passive ability with weapons like Revolver and Katana to speed up the 15,000 kill requirement. Prioritize Damage Tome and Precision Tome for faster clear times.
            </div>

            <h3>Step 2: Unlock Mines via Slutty Rocket</h3>
            <p>After obtaining Slutty Rocket, the second unlock stage begins:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requirement:</strong> Kill 7,500 enemies using Slutty Rocket weapon</li>
                <li><strong>Any character:</strong> Can be completed with any unlocked character</li>
                <li><strong>Estimated time:</strong> 5-8 hours focused on Slutty Rocket damage</li>
                <li><strong>Cumulative tracking:</strong> Progress counts across all runs, not single-run completion</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The 7,500 kill requirement specifically tracks enemies killed by Slutty Rocket's direct damage. This means players must actively use Slutty Rocket as a primary or secondary weapon rather than letting other weapons carry damage output. The tracking system counts only final blows attributed to Slutty Rocket, not assists or damage contributions from other sources.</p>

            <h3>Unlock Verification</h3>
            <p>Players can check progress toward the Mines unlock through the Statistics menu showing Slutty Rocket kill count. Once 7,500 kills are reached, Mines becomes purchasable in the <strong>Unlocks menu → Weapons tab for 2 Silver</strong>. The silver cost is trivial compared to the time investment required to meet the kill threshold.</p>

            <div class="info-box danger">
                <strong>🚫 Reality Check:</strong> The double-unlock requirement for Mines creates a 15-20 hour time investment for one of the weakest weapons in the game. Community consensus strongly recommends skipping this unlock entirely and focusing efforts on meta weapons and characters instead.
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Mechanics -->
        <section id="mechanics">
            <h2>⚙️ Core Mechanics & Trap System</h2>
            
            <p>Mines operates through a <strong>passive trap placement system</strong> fundamentally different from active projectile weapons. When equipped, the weapon periodically drops explosive mines on the ground beneath the player's position. These mines remain stationary until an enemy walks over them, triggering explosion damage in a small area-of-effect radius.</p>

            <h3>Damage Application</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Base damage:</strong> 7 per explosion (among the lowest in the game)</li>
                <li><strong>Trigger mechanism:</strong> Enemy proximity/contact activates mines</li>
                <li><strong>AoE damage:</strong> Small explosion radius affects multiple enemies if clustered</li>
                <li><strong>Mine persistence:</strong> Placed mines remain indefinitely until triggered or map clear</li>
                <li><strong>Placement cooldown:</strong> Automatic deployment at fixed intervals (undocumented exact timing)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Placement Behavior</h3>
            <p>The mine deployment system follows these rules:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Mines drop at player's current position during placement cycle</li>
                <li>New mines overwrite old mines at the same location (no stacking)</li>
                <li>Maximum mine count on field is limited (exact number undocumented, estimated 15-20)</li>
                <li>Oldest mines disappear when cap is reached and new ones are placed</li>
                <li>Mines do not damage the player or allies (friendly fire disabled)</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Critical Limitation:</strong> Mines' passive placement means players cannot control exactly where traps deploy. The weapon drops mines wherever the player happens to be standing, often creating suboptimal trap fields in low-traffic areas while leaving high-priority choke points undefended.
            </div>

            <h3>Upgrade Interaction</h3>
            <p>The five upgrade paths affect Mines as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damage:</strong> Increases explosion damage linearly (essential for viability)</li>
                <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Increases number of mines deployed per placement cycle</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Expands explosion radius for better AoE coverage</li>
                <li><strong>Projectile Speed:</strong> No effect (mines are stationary traps)</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Extends mine persistence before auto-despawn</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Unlike weapons with crit scaling or pierce mechanics, Mines lacks compound upgrade synergies. Damage increases are purely additive, and the weapon cannot benefit from critical hit builds, attack speed scaling, or on-hit effects that trigger from active combat. This fundamental limitation means Mines scales poorly compared to meta alternatives that leverage multiplicative stat interactions.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Character Synergies -->
        <section id="synergies">
            <h2>👥 Limited Character Synergies</h2>
            
            <p><strong>No character in Megabonk's roster provides meaningful synergies with Mines</strong>, making it equally mediocre across all playable options. Unlike weapons with signature characters—Aura with Megachad, Katana with Ninja, or Dice with Dicehead—Mines exists as a generic weapon with no specialized support.</p>

            <h3>Why No Character Works Well</h3>
            
            <h4>Speed Characters (Calcium, Tony McZoom)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anti-synergy:</strong> High mobility means mines are placed far apart in spread-out patterns</li>
                <li><strong>Coverage issue:</strong> Fast movement creates gaps between mine placements</li>
                <li><strong>Playstyle conflict:</strong> Speed builds benefit from active damage weapons, not passive traps</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Tank Characters (Sir Oofie, Megachad)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Positioning problem:</strong> Tanks typically stand still with Aura/Aegis, negating area coverage</li>
                <li><strong>Better alternatives:</strong> Aura provides superior passive damage without trap limitations</li>
                <li><strong>Survivability waste:</strong> Tank builds don't leverage mines' theoretical defensive utility</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>DPS Characters (Dicehead, CL4NK, Bandit)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Damage inefficiency:</strong> Low base damage can't compete with crit-scaling weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Active combat focus:</strong> DPS builds optimize for direct damage, not trap placement</li>
                <li><strong>Slot opportunity cost:</strong> Every weapon slot with Mines is a slot not using Revolver/Katana/Bow</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box tip">
                <strong>💡 Least-Bad Option:</strong> If forced to use Mines, characters with balanced mobility work marginally better than extremes. Fox or Robinette provide moderate movement speed that creates reasonable trap spacing without the coverage gaps of ultra-fast or ultra-slow characters.
            </div>

            <h3>Tome Scaling Limitations</h3>
            <p>Standard tome investments provide minimal benefit to Mines:</p>

                        <td>Increases explosion damage</td>
                        <td>Mandatory but insufficient alone</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Cooldown Tome</td>
                        <td>Faster mine placement rate</td>
                        <td>Marginal improvement</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Size Tome</td>
                        <td>Larger explosion radius</td>
                        <td>Moderate value for AoE</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Precision Tome</td>
                        <td>No effect (mines don't crit)</td>
                        <td>Wasted investment</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Quantity Tome</td>
                        <td>More mines per placement</td>
                        <td>Better coverage but low damage persists</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>The critical issue: even with perfect tome scaling and character selection, Mines' fundamental design prevents competitive viability. The weapon lacks the exponential scaling mechanics that enable S-tier weapons to reach 100,000+ kill runs. Players investing in Mines optimization would achieve superior results by switching to literally any meta weapon with the same tome investment.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Builds -->
        <section id="builds">
            <h2>🔨 Trap Zone Area Control Build</h2>
            
            <p>For players committed to using Mines despite its weaknesses, the optimal approach maximizes trap coverage and damage through strategic item/tome selection. This build acknowledges Mines cannot serve as a primary damage source and instead positions it as area denial support for superior weapons.</p>

            <h3>Build Philosophy</h3>
            <p>The core strategy treats Mines as a <strong>defensive fourth weapon slot</strong> rather than damage carry. Players lay trap fields in choke points and retreat paths while relying on three other weapons for actual killing power. Mines provides marginal value by creating "breathing room" zones where pursuing enemies take incidental damage, slowing their advance and creating tactical space.</p>

            <h3>Weapon Loadout</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Aura or Dexecutioner (actual damage dealer)</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Katana or Revolver (high DPS backup)</li>
                <li><strong>Tertiary:</strong> Lightning Staff or Bow (range coverage)</li>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Mines (trap placement for area control)</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box tip">
                <strong>💡 Key Insight:</strong> This four-weapon setup relegates Mines to the least important slot. If better weapons appear in chests or vendors during the run, immediately replace Mines without hesitation. The trap placement provides so little value that any S-tier or A-tier weapon represents a strict upgrade.

            <div class="info-box danger">
                <strong>🚫 Reality Check:</strong> Even with perfect execution of this optimized build, Mines contributes less than 5% of total damage in most runs.

            <h3>Comparison to Meta Alternatives</h3>
            <p>Direct performance comparison against similar weapons:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Aura:</strong> Provides continuous 360° passive damage without trap limitations, scales infinitely better</li>
                <li><strong>Toxic Barrel:</strong> Also creates area damage zones but triggers automatically on taking damage, more reliable</li>
                <li><strong>Ice Cube:</strong> Freeze mechanic provides crowd control value Mines lacks despite similar trap concept</li>
                <li><strong>Aegis:</strong> Shield blocking + counterattack creates better defensive value than mine traps</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Statistical Reality:</strong> In analysis of 1,000+ documented successful Tier 3 runs, Mines appeared in exactly zero weapon loadouts. The weapon sees no competitive use whatsoever, existing purely as an optional unlock for completion purposes.
            </div>

            <h3>Why Mines Fails</h3>
            <p>Community analysis identifies multiple fundamental problems:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Lowest damage tier:</strong> 7 base damage cannot compete with modern meta</li>
                <li><strong>Passive damage application:</strong> Players cannot control when/where mines trigger</li>
                <li><strong>Opportunity cost:</strong> Every weapon slot matters, Mines wastes one</li>
                <li><strong>No scaling mechanics:</strong> Lacks crit, pierce, bounce, or compound upgrade synergies</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme unlock requirements:</strong> 20-hour time investment for worst-tier weapon</li>
                <li><strong>Zero character synergies:</strong> No character makes Mines viable</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of developer support:</strong> No buffs across three major patches</li>
            </ol>

        <!-- Version History -->
        <section id="history">
            <h2>📜 Version History & Balance Changes</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Mines has received zero direct balance changes across all documented patch versions</strong>, suggesting the weapon exists in a state of benign neglect by developer vedinad. The complete absence of buffs, nerfs, or mechanical adjustments indicates either the weapon is considered balanced (unlikely given community feedback) or simply not a priority for development resources.</p>

            <h3>Patch Timeline</h3>

            <h4>Version 1.0.4 (Early September 2025)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial Megabonk release version</li>
                <li>Mines included in weapon pool with 7 base damage</li>
                <li>Double-unlock system implemented (Slutty Rocket → Mines)</li>
                <li>No balance notes specific to Mines</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Version 1.0.7 (September 29, 2025)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Major patch addressing Kevin invincibility exploit</li>
                <li>Leaderboard reset due to exploit abuse</li>
                <li>Character buffs for Athena and Bush</li>
                <li><strong>Zero mentions of Mines</strong> in patch notes</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Version 1.0.12 (October 8, 2025) - Current</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Black Hole hitbox fixes and proc coefficient nerfs</li>
                <li>Joe's Dagger damage cap implementation</li>
                <li>XP Tome nerf from 9% to 7%</li>
                <li>Duration bug fixes for multiple weapons</li>
                <li><strong>Still no direct Mines changes</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Indirect Effects</h3>
            <p>While Mines received no targeted updates, some system-wide changes marginally affected it:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>XP Tome nerf (v1.0.12):</strong> Slower leveling means delayed Mines upgrades, minor indirect nerf</li>
                <li><strong>Duration system rework (v1.0.12):</strong> Caps on duration scaling may affect mine persistence</li>
                <li><strong>Damage Tome standardization:</strong> All weapons benefit equally from damage scaling, no relative change</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box danger">
                <strong>🚫 Community Frustration:</strong> The complete lack of developer attention has frustrated players who invested significant time unlocking Mines only to discover it's non-viable. Multiple Steam reviews specifically mention "wasted 20+ hours unlocking Mines" as a negative aspect of the game's balance.
            </div>

            <h3>Requested Buffs Never Implemented</h3>
            <p>Community suggestions for improving Mines include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Double base damage to 14 (still below average but more reasonable)</li>
                <li>Add trigger-on-death mechanic where dying enemies explode into mines</li>
                <li>Enable manual mine placement with aiming rather than passive drops</li>
                <li>Introduce mine chaining where one explosion triggers nearby mines for combos</li>
                <li>Implement remote detonation allowing players to trigger all mines simultaneously</li>
            </ul>

            <p>None of these proposed improvements have been acknowledged or implemented. Developer vedinad's focus remains on balancing S-tier weapons (Black Hole, Joe's Dagger), addressing game-breaking exploits, and introducing new content rather than rescuing bottom-tier weapons like Mines.</p>

            <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Aura is objectively superior in every measurable way.</p>

            <h3>Mines vs Toxic Barrel (Area Damage Item)</h3>
            <p>Toxic Barrel is an <em>item</em> rather than weapon, but provides similar area denial concept:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Toxic Barrel:</strong> Releases poison clouds when player takes damage, creating reactive area denial</li>
                <li><strong>Mines:</strong> Requires enemies to walk into specific locations for damage</li>
                <li><strong>Advantage:</strong> Toxic Barrel is an item slot rather than weapon slot, allowing full weapon loadout</li>
                <li><strong>Synergy:</strong> Toxic Barrel works with any weapon build; Mines forces suboptimal weapon choices</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mines vs Ice Cube (Control Trap)</h3>
            <p>Ice Cube legendary item provides 7.5% freeze chance on hit plus area freeze:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Control value:</strong> Freezing enemies provides crowd control Mines lacks</li>
                <li><strong>Proc synergy:</strong> Ice Cube triggers from any weapon hit, Mines requires enemies walking into zones</li>
                <li><strong>Legendary status:</strong> Ice Cube is hard to acquire but game-changing; Mines is easy to unlock but worthless</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box tip">
                <strong>💡 Alternative Recommendation:</strong> Players interested in area control should pursue Aura weapon + Toxic Barrel item + Ice Cube legendary combination. This provides superior control and damage with none of Mines' limitations.

            <h3>Comparison to Other Bottom-Tier Weapons</h3>

            <p>Even comparing to similarly weak weapons, Mines offers the least utility and value of any bottom-tier option.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Tactics -->
        <section id="tactics">
            <h2>🎯 Tactical Placement & Limited Use Cases</h2>
            
            <p>For the small subset of players determined to use Mines despite overwhelming evidence against it, understanding optimal placement patterns and strategic applications can marginally improve performance. However, even perfect execution cannot overcome the weapon's fundamental design failures.</p>

            <h3>Choke Point Control</h3>
            <p>Mines performs <em>relatively</em> better (still poorly) in narrow passages:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify terrain bottlenecks:</strong> Forest map trees and Desert map rock formations create natural funnels</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-emptive placement:</strong> Drop mines in choke points before enemies arrive</li>
                <li><strong>Retreat pathing:</strong> Place mines along planned escape routes to damage pursuers</li>
                <li><strong>Stacking strategy:</strong> Multiple mine placements in the same area increase coverage density</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Practical Problem:</strong> Mines' passive placement means players cannot reliably target choke points. The weapon drops traps wherever the player happens to be standing, often missing strategic locations entirely.
            </div>

            <h3>Boss Arena Applications</h3>
            <p>Against bosses, Mines provides minimal value:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Boss spawn adds:</strong> Place mines near boss spawn points to damage minions automatically</li>
                <li><strong>Kiting zones:</strong> Drop mines in circular kite paths around boss arenas</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency escapes:</strong> Mine-covered retreat zones can provide minimal damage to pursuing enemies</li>
                <li><strong>Reality check:</strong> Boss fights require high burst DPS; Mines' 7 base damage is essentially irrelevant</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Predictive Placement</h3>
            <p>Advanced players can attempt to predict enemy movement:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Observe enemy spawn patterns and approach vectors</li>
                <li>Position character in predicted enemy paths</li>
                <li>Drop mines in advance of enemy waves</li>
                <li>Retreat before enemies arrive, letting traps trigger automatically</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This tactic requires extensive map knowledge and enemy behavior understanding while providing minimal damage payoff. The time investment learning these patterns would yield superior results if applied to mastering S-tier weapons instead.</p>

            <h3>Use Cases Where Mines Has Marginal Value</h3>

            <h4>AFK Challenge Runs</h4>
            <p>The only semi-viable use case: Mines can contribute to AFK (away-from-keyboard) builds where players intentionally minimize active input. Combined with Aura, Aegis, and defensive items, Mines adds minor passive damage to auto-farming strategies. However, even in AFK contexts, replacing Mines with a second AoE weapon like Lightning Staff or Bone improves clear times.</p>

            <h4>Learning Runs for New Players</h4>
            <p>Theoretically, Mines could teach positioning awareness and predictive gameplay concepts. In practice, new players benefit more from learning with functional weapons rather than handicapping themselves with bottom-tier options.</p>

            <h4>Challenge Run Restrictions</h4>
            <p>If attempting self-imposed challenge runs restricting weapon choices (e.g., "complete Tier 1 with only C-tier weapons"), Mines becomes viable by necessity rather than merit. This represents the weapon's primary existence: novelty experimentation rather than optimal play.</p>

            <div class="info-box danger">
                <strong>🚫 Final Reality:</strong> There are no scenarios where Mines is the optimal choice. In every situation where Mines provides any value, alternative weapons provide more value. The weapon exists as a failed design experiment rather than a strategic option.

            <h3>When to Consider Mines</h3>
            <p>Honest assessment of situations where Mines has any arguable use:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Completion purposes:</strong> Players pursuing 100% weapon unlock achievements</li>
                <li><strong>Novelty experimentation:</strong> Testing unusual builds for entertainment value</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge restrictions:</strong> Self-imposed rules requiring bottom-tier weapon usage</li>
                <li><strong>Content creation:</strong> YouTubers/streamers showcasing "worst weapon" runs</li>
                <li><strong>Learning defensive concepts:</strong> Understanding positioning and zone control (better alternatives exist)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When to Absolutely Avoid Mines</h3>
            <p>Situations where Mines actively hurts progression:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Competitive play:</strong> Any attempt at leaderboard rankings or high-tier completion</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient progression:</strong> Players trying to unlock content or level up characters quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Tier 2+ content:</strong> Mines cannot handle increased enemy HP pools in advanced stages</li>
                <li><strong>Boss fights:</strong> Low damage makes Mines irrelevant against high-HP bosses</li>
                <li><strong>Limited playtime:</strong> Players with restricted schedules should optimize weapon choices</li>
                <li><strong>New players:</strong> Learning with Mines teaches bad habits and wrong strategies</li>
            </ul>

                <strong>💡 Honest Recommendation:</strong> Skip unlocking Mines entirely. The 20-hour investment required could instead be spent: unlocking strong characters (CL4NK, Bandit, Dicehead), mastering meta weapons (Aura, Dexecutioner, Katana), completing actual progression (Tier 2-3 stages), or learning advanced techniques (bunnyhopping, shrine optimization).

            <h3>If Already Unlocked</h3>
            <p>For players who already invested time unlocking Mines:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Accept the sunk cost:</strong> Past time investment doesn't justify continued use</li>
                <li><strong>Experiment once:</strong> Try Mines in a casual Tier 1 run to satisfy curiosity</li>
                <li><strong>Move on immediately:</strong> After experimentation, never equip Mines again</li>
                <li><strong>Use Toggler system:</strong> Toggle off Mines in upgrade selection pool to prevent accidental pickups</li>

            <h2>🔍 Critical Assessment & Design Analysis</h2>
            
            <p>Mines represents a <strong>failed weapon design experiment</strong> in Megabonk's arsenal, suffering from multiple compounding issues that prevent viability at any skill level or build investment. Analyzing the weapon's problems reveals fundamental flaws rather than fixable balance issues.</p>

            <h3>Core Design Problems</h3>

            <h4>1. Passive Damage Application</h4>
            <p>The trap mechanic removes player agency. Unlike active weapons where skilled players can optimize damage through positioning, aiming, and timing, Mines require enemies to walk into arbitrary locations. This creates frustrating gameplay where damage feels random rather than earned through skillful play.</p>

            <h4>2. Lowest-Tier Base Damage</h4>
            <p>With 7 base damage, Mines sits below almost every weapon in the game. This number cannot compete with modern enemy HP pools—Desert enemies at Tier 2 have 500,000+ HP, making Mines' damage contribution essentially a rounding error. Even with maximum Damage Tome scaling, the weapon never reaches competitive output.</p>

            <h4>3. No Compound Scaling Mechanics</h4>
            <p>S-tier weapons succeed through multiplicative stat interactions: Katana benefits from crit chance × crit damage × attack speed, Aura scales with size × damage × duration creating exponential growth, and Dexecutioner gains pierce × execute × quantity multiplication. Mines only scales additively through damage increases, creating a linear growth curve that falls further behind exponential alternatives every minute of gameplay.</p>

            <h4>4. Extreme Unlock Investment vs Weak Payoff</h4>
            <p>The 20-hour unlock requirement (15,000 CL4NK kills + 7,500 Slutty Rocket kills) represents one of the game's most demanding weapon unlocks. Players who complete this marathon grind discover a weapon significantly weaker than the Sword provided to every character at the start. This massive investment-to-reward imbalance creates legitimate player frustration reflected in negative Steam reviews.</p>

            <h4>5. Zero Character Synergies</h4>
            <p>Every successful weapon in Megabonk has at least one character providing meaningful synergies: Aura synergizes with Megachad's tank passive, enabling the "Walking Apocalypse" meta build. Katana transforms Ninja through attack speed scaling and evasion execute combos. Dice defines Dicehead's entire character identity through permanent crit stacking. Mines works equally poorly on every character, lacking any design space for optimization or specialized builds.</p>

            <h3>Comparison to Similar Failed Designs</h3>
            <p>Other games have attempted similar "trap placement" mechanics with varying success:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Path of Exile's Traps:</strong> Succeed through high burst damage compensating for delayed activation</li>
                <li><strong>Vampire Survivors' Garlic:</strong> Succeeds through constant passive damage without enemy interaction requirement</li>
                <li><strong>Hades' Trippy Shot:</strong> Succeeds through manual aiming control and Hangover status application</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Mines fails where these succeed because it combines the worst aspects: low damage, no player control, and passive triggering requirement.</p>

            <h3>Why Buffs Haven't Materialized</h3>
            <p>Developer vedinad's focus on balancing S-tier weapons (Black Hole, Joe's Dagger) rather than buffing F-tier options (Mines) reflects sound game design philosophy. Resources are better spent: ensuring competitive weapons remain balanced, addressing game-breaking exploits (Kevin invincibility), and creating new content that engages the player base. Rescuing fundamentally flawed weapons like Mines would require complete mechanical redesigns rather than numerical tweaks, making it low-priority development work with minimal player benefit.</p>

            <div class="info-box danger">
                <strong>🚫 Design Verdict:</strong> Mines would require a complete mechanical overhaul to become viable. Simply increasing base damage to 20-30 wouldn't solve the core issue of passive, uncontrollable trap placement. The weapon needs either manual placement mechanics, trigger-on-death explosions, or remote detonation control—fundamental changes developer vedinad has shown no interest in implementing.

                <li><strong>Slot 3:</strong> Lightning Staff or Bow (range coverage)</li>
                <li><strong>Slot 4:</strong> Mines (experimental utility)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Tome Priority</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Damage Tome (mandatory for all weapons)</li>
                <li>Size Tome (improves Aura and Mines simultaneously)</li>
                <li>Quantity Tome (more mines = better coverage)</li>
                <li>XP Tome (faster progression for actual useful weapons)</li>
                <li>Cooldown Tome (marginal mine placement frequency benefit)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Essential Items</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Gym Sauce (+10% damage to all sources including mines)</li>
                <li>Spicy Meatball (25% explosion chance creates compound AoE)</li>

                <li>Boss Buster (+15% vs Elites/Bosses)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Strategy</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat Mines as fourth weapon utility slot, never primary damage</li>
                <li>Focus 90% of upgrades on Aura/Dexecutioner/Lightning Staff</li>
                <li>Use Mines in choke points during retreat phases</li>
                <li>Replace immediately if superior weapons appear in chests</li>
                <li>Accept that Mines contributes <5% total damage</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Optimal Alternative Build (Strong Recommendation)</h3>
            <p>What players should use instead of wasting time with Mines:</p>

            <h4>Meta Weapon Loadout</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Aura:</strong> Core passive damage, exponential scaling</li>
                <li><strong>Dexecutioner:</strong> Pierce + execute mechanics, S-tier DPS</li>
                <li><strong>Katana:</strong> Fast attacks, crit scaling, proven meta</li>
                <li><strong>Lightning Staff or Bow:</strong> Range coverage, high damage</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Holy Trinity Foundation</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>XP Tome (level faster for more upgrades)</li>
                <li>Luck Tome (improve upgrade quality)</li>
                <li>Cursed Tome (more enemies = more drops)</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Scaling Multipliers</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Damage Tome (universal scaling for all weapons)</li>
                <li>Size Tome (massive Aura expansion)</li>
                <li>Precision Tome (crit scaling for Katana/Dexecutioner)</li>
                <li>Quantity Tome (more projectiles = more damage)</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>S-Tier Items</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Overpowered Lamp (doubles on-hit effect procs)</li>
                <li>Giant Fork (enables Megacrits)</li>
                <li>Forbidden Juice (+10% crit chance)</li>

        <!-- Conclusion -->
        <section id="conclusion">
            <h2>🎬 Final Verdict</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Mines is a C-tier/D-tier weapon that should be skipped by all players pursuing efficient progression or competitive gameplay.</strong> The weapon combines the worst possible traits: lowest-tier damage (7 base), passive uncontrollable mechanics, extreme unlock requirements (20+ hours), zero character synergies, and no developer support across three major patches.</p>

            <h3>Who Should Use Mines?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Players completing 100% achievement unlock collections</li>
                <li>Content creators showcasing "worst weapon challenge" runs</li>
                <li>Experimental players exhausted all meta strategies</li>
                <li>Nobody pursuing optimal results or efficient progression</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who Should Avoid Mines?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New players learning the game (teaches bad habits)</li>
                <li>Competitive players targeting leaderboards (zero meta presence)</li>
                <li>Efficiency-focused players (massive time waste)</li>
                <li>Tier 2+ progression attempts (inadequate damage scaling)</li>
                <li>Limited playtime players (optimize weapon choices instead)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Harsh Truth</h3>
            <p>Community analysis reveals that <strong>Mines appears in exactly 0% of documented successful Tier 3 runs</strong>. The weapon sees no competitive use whatsoever, existing purely as a failed design experiment. Players who invest 20+ hours unlocking Mines discover a weapon objectively weaker than the starting Sword, creating legitimate frustration reflected in negative Steam reviews.</p>

            <p>The weapon would require complete mechanical redesign—manual placement control, trigger-on-death explosions, remote detonation, or fundamentally different damage application—to become viable. Developer vedinad has shown no interest in these extensive changes across three major patches, suggesting acceptance of Mines as a bottom-tier novelty option rather than competitive weapon.</p>

            <h3>Alternative Recommendations</h3>
            <p>Instead of pursuing Mines, players should invest time in:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mastering S-tier weapons:</strong> Aura, Dexecutioner, Katana, Flamewalker provide proven competitive viability</li>
                <li><strong>Unlocking strong characters:</strong> Dicehead, Bandit, CL4NK offer superior scaling and gameplay</li>
                <li><strong>Learning advanced techniques:</strong> Bunnyhopping, shrine optimization, tome priority strategies</li>
                <li><strong>Progressing through Tiers:</strong> Completing Desert and Forest content unlocks better weapons/characters</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Holy Trinity:</strong> XP + Luck + Cursed Tome combination enables all successful runs</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box warning">
                <strong>⚠️ Final Warning:</strong> Do not unlock Mines. The 20-hour time investment produces a weapon that contributes nothing to successful runs. Every hour spent grinding Slutty Rocket kills could instead progress meaningful content or master viable strategies. This is not hyperbole or exaggeration—Mines is genuinely one of the worst time investments in Megabonk.
            </div>

            <h3>The Only Exception</h3>
            <p>If you're a completionist who feels psychological satisfaction from unlocking every weapon regardless of viability, then pursue Mines for that specific reason. Just understand you're unlocking a collectible rather than a useful tool—similar to collecting every mount in World of Warcraft or every achievement in Steam. The satisfaction comes from completion percentage, not from the weapon itself having value.</p>

            <p><strong>Overall Assessment: D-Tier (Avoid)</strong></p>
            <p>Mines exists as a cautionary example of trap weapon design—literally and figuratively. Players seeking success in Megabonk should focus exclusively on proven meta weapons and character builds, leaving Mines as a curiosity in the weapon selection menu rather than an equipped choice.</p>
